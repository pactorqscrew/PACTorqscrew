									<h1>Finance & Marketing </h1>
									
								</header>

								<p> Be prepared to be amazed by the high-ended, yet adrenalizing world of Finances! This team deals with “cash flow” at various levels, as the name suggests.
								</p>
								<p>
									The first part Finance- deals with handling of sources of income of the club. It begins with production’s cost analysis. This in turn involves budgeting, and to some extent logistics. This team works very closely with each of the sub-teams, and it is necessary for this team’s members to be actively involved with the end-to-end process of manufacturing and be well acquainted with processes followed by the other sub-teams; basically, just a peripheral approach in work, is not expected rather they must be very thorough in their approach. This is perhaps one of the most demanding sub-teams, yet very much rewarding.
								</p>
								<p>
									This process of finance evolves deeply into accounting, which consists of documentation of each transaction, this is done using balance sheets (cost reports), and the process finally concludes with cost analysis, which is the most important part of the cycle, as it is necessary for understanding of the admin team and the people in-charge.
								</p>
								<p>
									So, if finance is something that excites you, or you just want to try something out, this is a great starting point!
								</p>
								<p>
									Perks: 
								</p>
								<p>
									1. &nbsp; This is a subject which is of perhaps the most importance (yet we lack the necessary knowledge in it), in real life, thus be developing skills which are necessary throughout your life.
								</p>
								<p>
									2.  &nbsp;  You will be building a core domain, simultaneously
								</p>
								<p>
									3. &nbsp;  Having fun while working is the most important take-away, since you’ll be handling immense pressure at times, learning to be meticulous in your work, without panicking is an important art you’ll master.
								</p>
