								<p> While Partnerships guys are dealing with the outside world, Public Relations’ team takes care of the internal necessities of the team. They work closely with other sub teams to ensure we are on track with our schedule, they handle logistics to a great extent and provide any support deemed necessary by the team. They make collaborations which will aid in smooth and efficient functioning of the various sub-teams, with their focus being on optimizing the methodology used in manufacturing. Arranging technical seminars, workshops for team’s learning is done by them, thus ensuring enhanced performance as a team!
								</p>
								<p>
									If expressing yourself (through any form) amazes you, then this could be your perfect sub-team! Here you will get opportunities to create content, designs, use digital art to form sketches, posters, videos, and much more exciting stuff awaits you, because here creativity is unleashed; and thus at times it reaches peaks! 

								</p>
								<p>
									If writing a blog, or reading about a trendy topic, or chatting about various fields is something you like doing, then you are a content person. 
								</p>
                                <p>
                                    If you aren’t much of a “people person,” but have been attracted to making your own mark in this world, then you should try out the design team. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It’s not necessary to have any prior knowledge of any sort to join any sub-team.
                                </p>
